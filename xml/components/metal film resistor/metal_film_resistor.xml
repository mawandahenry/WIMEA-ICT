	<!-- COMPONENT DESCRIPTION -->
	<description>
		Thin film resistors are created using a technique called sputtering which permits a very thin and controlled layer of a material,
		tantalum nitride or Nichrome, to be deposited onto a substrate.
		The environment in which the film is laid and without the necessity for high power laser trimming ensures a very stable and accurate resistor.
