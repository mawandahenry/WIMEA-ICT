	<description>
		The SD Card Module is a simple solution for transferring data to and from a standard SD card. 
        The pinout is directly compatible with Arduino, but can also be used with other microcontrollers. 
        This module has SPI interface which is compatible with any sd card and it use 5V or 3.3V power supply which is compatible with Arduino UNO/Mega.
        SD card module has various applications such as data logger, audio, video, graphics.
         In the WIMEA-ICT LPG it is used hold the SD card so as weather data can be saved onto it.
