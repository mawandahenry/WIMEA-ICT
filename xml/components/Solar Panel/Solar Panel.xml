	<!-- COMPONENT DESCRIPTION -->
	<description>
		The solar Panel receives the sunlight and converts it to electrical energy which is used to charge the Lithium ion capacitor or Lithium ion battery.
		0.5W Solar Panel 70x55x3 mm is monocrystalline silicon solar panel, which is the main trend in the future.
		Comparing to polycrystalline silicon solar panel and thin-film solar panel, monocrystalline silicon solar panel performs higher conversion rate that up to 17%.
		The surface is covered by fine resin which makes it waterproof, together with a very sturdy back, it is really suitable for outdoor environment.
		Depending on light intensity, the typical open circuit voltage is 5V.
