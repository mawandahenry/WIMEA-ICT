***an automated setup guide for all weather users***
- current issues that need attention
> manual simulation</br>
> automatic simulation</br>
- [x] @sewante finished audio synchronization and putting together the explore module :smiley: :sparkles:</br>
- [x] @mawanda Henry finished part of the mannual simualation(cores) :+1:</br>
- [x] @grace and Umar worked on the current version of the auto-simulation. :octocat:</br>

- ***manual simualation :grimacing: :sweat: ***
> The collision detection algorithm located in js/main.js has to be revisited because it failed to check for collisions between lines and images from top and bottom.</br>
> If possible the drawn lines can be made responsive so  that if one resizes the browser, then the lines should try to blend in

- ***auto simualation :grimacing: :sweat: ***
> The stop and pause buttons are still a challenge in that they disrupt the normal flow of the animation.</br>
> The algorithms have to be updated so that they don't stick on one module type. they have to be dynamic in one way or the other
